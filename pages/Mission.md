Our planet faces an anthropological extinction, exacerbated by decades of unsustainability. I am committed to a #zerowaste future, follow along with my mission here: 

<p><b>1. Decreasing plastic waste</b></p>
   <p>Although plastic waste is predominated by fishing equipment in the ocean, consumer waste still makes up a significant portion of waste. Decreasing plastic waste, specifically single-use plastics, is an initiative anyone can take part in. You can bring your own utensils in a reusable bag, and wash after means. Switch from bottles of shampoo and conditioner to shampoo and conditioner bars from Ethique.

<p><b>2. Going meatless</b></p>
   <p>What I thought would have been a major challenge ended up being the easiest change of all. I had never enjoyed cooking meat, and I found it easy to cut meat out of my diet. In addition, I am slowly decreasing consumption of animal products. I've started making my own oat milk to replace my whole milk (it's delicious and froths well too!)

<p><b>3. No-buy</b></p>
   <p>It's easy to look at ads and impulsively purchase a nifty new gadget, a gorgeous new shirt, or a beautifully packaged makeup-item. The best way to lead a sustainable life is to simply buy less. Resources are consumed at an unsustainable rate to keep up with fast-fashion. Child labor is implicated in mica-mining for makeup. More and more waste is generated when we buy and toss out. Ask your self if it's something you need, and will you actually have space for it in your life.
